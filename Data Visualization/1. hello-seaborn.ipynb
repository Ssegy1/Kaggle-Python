    "In this hands-on course, you'll learn how to take your data visualizations to the next level with [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html), a powerful but easy-to-use data visualization tool.  To use seaborn, you'll also learn a bit about how to write code in Python, a popular programming language.  That said,\n",
    "- the course is aimed at those with no prior programming experience, and\n",
    "- each chart uses short and simple code, making seaborn much faster and easier to use than many other data visualization tools (_such as Excel, for instance_).  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you've never written a line of code, and you want to learn the **_bare minimum_** to start making faster, more attractive plots today, you're in the right place!  To take a peek at some of the charts you'll make, check out the figures below.\n",
